To satisfy this project's requirements, I will create my own associations between models and not use those provided by RSpotify.

RSpotify serves as a wrapper to help retrieve and parse data from Spotify's API via Ruby.

I've used the gem omniauth-spotify to authenticate users via Sinatra, since RSpotify uses Rails.

Purpose of this program:
+ Start storing data on your recently played songs on Spotify
+ Display the album covers on past songs in a clean, customizable grid
+ Play 30-second clips of each song to briefly relive the moment
