To satisfy this project's requirements, I will create my own associations between models and not use those provided by RSpotify.

RSpotify serves as a wrapper to help retrieve and parse data from Spotify's API via Ruby.

I've used the gem omniauth-spotify to authenticate users via Sinatra, since RSpotify uses Rails.

TODO:

1. Layout -- All user to choose number between 10 and 20

2. After going from setup, keep preferred songs as is (do not go to default setting)

3. Play songs on click
